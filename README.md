pathX Mini-Game for CSE219

This repository will contain a semester long project from the CSE219 course.

The goal of the project is to create a near fully featured Mini-Game that could be playable on a mobile device. 
Specifically, this game is called pathX and the details of the rules and goals are detailed in the Software 
Requirements Specification document given to me by my proffessor Richard McKenna.

This project will represent a culmination of the various aspects of software development that I have learned during
the course, including UI development, thread management, software design, object oriented programming, and many other 
subjects. 

The application will built on top of the Mini-Game Framework provided and created by Proffessor Richard McKenna.
